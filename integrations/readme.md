# Integration Examples
Using Go by itself isn't enough, how can we use it with various other systems? This directory is just some practice using Go with databases, message brokers, etc.

## Examples
### Message Brokers
* [kafka](https://github.com/jamescarr/go-learning/tree/master/integrations/kafka)
* rabbitmq

### Databases
* [SQL, GORM and more](https://github.com/jamescarr/go-learning/tree/master/integrations/sql)
* redis
* [memcached](https://github.com/jamescarr/go-learning/tree/master/integrations/memcached)

### Service Discovery
* consul
* etcd
* zookeeper
